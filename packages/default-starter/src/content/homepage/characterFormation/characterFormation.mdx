## CHARACTER FORMATION
### Growing every student’s personal character
We are passionate about investing into the growth of student’s personal character. As soon as a new student starts at ACC Singleton teachers seek to get to know the individual. Staff establish an authentic, positive and transparent relationship with parents and take the responsibility of partnering with the family in the development of the whole child seriously.

Young people should emerge from school able to empathise with people, to understand the nuances of social interaction, to stretch beyond what’s considered normal in the pursuit of a goal and to approach challenges with courage.

We all know that people of deep and rich personal character are resilient, humble, self-controlled and compassionate. At ACC Singleton we teach our students about personal character in line with ourStudent Attributes. Our staff also seek to model these attributes and call students to a high standard of behaviour.
