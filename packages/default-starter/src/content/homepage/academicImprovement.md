## ACADEMIC IMPROVEMENT
### We have a plan for your child's learning

Your child can thrive in his or her learning at ACC Singleton, so that they’re well-prepared and
resourced for adult life. This is achieved by developing a clear plan for your child’s learning.


This plan is built on a foundation of:

- backed teaching method that is characterised by well-planned, engaging and
well-delivered lessons;

- a robust teacher improvement model where, every week, school leaders observe teaching and provide constructive and directive feedback to teachers that drives further improvements;  and
  
- a well-structured system of screening and assessing student performance in a timely and regular manner to make sure teachers are informed about the ongoing progress of student learning.


ACC students are continually challenged and unconditionally loved. Our students have teachers
who notice them, ask about their interests, listen to them, laugh with them and believe in them.
ACC students are well known, well loved and well taught by teachers who want the very best for
them.
